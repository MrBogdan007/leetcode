Time Complexity=runtime
Function that based on the input data resolves at different time (how much runtime grows)
X-axis: Input size (n)
Y-axis: Time taken to run the algorithm
So a plot of time complexity like O(n), O(nÂ²), or O(log n) shows how runtime grows as input size increases.

Space Complexity=memory
Just like time complexity, space complexity is also a function of input size n. But instead of measuring time, it measures memory used.
So you can visualize space complexity similarly:
X-axis: Input size n
Y-axis: Memory used (e.g., in bytes, variables, or abstract units)
